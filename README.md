# Translation CLI tool

This is a very simple tool for personal use. If you find it useful go ahead and
use or adapt.

Requires some setup/permissions:

- Google Translate API permissions via the default GCP account mechanism, and
- GCP project used, and
- Merriam-Webster API key for Thesaurus.

Check error messages (or read source code) to see the exact env variable names.

## Features

Translate from language to another; supports all Google Translate languages:

```bash
translate fi-FI en-US keitti√∂

```

If target language is en-US, retrieves extra information from Merriam-Webster.

To only find extra information for an English word from Merriam-Webster, just
give the term and nothing else.

```bash
translate kitchen
```
